    "\n",
    "* **Research Question:** How does the frequency of interaction with family, friends, coworkers, and neighbors relate to self-reported emotional health?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hypothesis:** Individuals who frequently interact with family, friends, coworkers, and neighbors will report better emotional health than those who interact less frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Variables:** Frequency of interaction with family (`CONNECTION_meaningful_time_family_grouped`), friends (`CONNECTION_preference_time_friends_grouped`), coworkers, neighbors (`CONNECTION_preference_time_neighbours_grouped`), and self-reported emotional health scores (`WORK_feel_stress`, `SUBSTANCE_USE_drugs_pain_killers`, `LONELY_existential_loneliness_scale_share`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Analysis:** Perform a correlation analysis to examine how the frequency of interactions with each group correlates with self-reported health.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Possible Results:** A positive correlation may emerge, suggesting that increased frequency of interactions aligns with better self-reported emotional health.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relevance:** This analysis could highlight how stronger social connections contribute to better health, aligning with the projectâ€™s objective of emphasizing the health benefits of social connections.\n"
